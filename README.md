# PBMath

PBMath is C library providing mathematical structures and functions.

The VecFloat structure and its functions can be used to manipulate vectors of float values.

The VecShort structure and its functions can be used to manipulate vectors of short values.

The MatFloat structure and its functions can be used to manipulate matrices of float values.

The Gauss structure and its functions can be used to get values of the Gauss function and random values distributed accordingly with a Gauss distribution.

The Smoother functions can be used to get values of the SmoothStep and SmootherStep functions.

The EqLinSys structure and its functions can be used to solve linear equation systems.
