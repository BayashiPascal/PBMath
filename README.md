# PBMath
PBMath is C library providing mathematical structures and functions.

The VecFloat structure and its functions can be used to manipulate vec-
tors of float values.

The VecShort structure and its functions can be used to manipulate vec-
tors of short values.

The MatFloat structure and its functions can be used to manipulate ma-
trices of float values.

The Shapoid structure and its functions can be used to manipulate
Shapoid objects (see next section for details).

The Gauss structure and its functions can be used to get values of the
Gauss function and random values distributed accordingly with a Gauss dis-
tribution.

The Smoother functions can be used to get values of the SmoothStep and
SmootherStep functions.
