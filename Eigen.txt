Compute Eigen values and vectors of A
A[i][j] <=> value of matrix A at the i-th column and j-th row
Must have nbCol(A) = nbRow(A)

err := 1.0
M := matrix identity of dimensions(nbCol(A) columns, nbRow(A) rows)
loop until err < epsilon
  Q,R := QRDecomposition(A)
  A := R * Q
  M := M * Q
  err := max(abs(non diagonal values of A))
for i := 0 to NbCol(A)
  eigenValue[i] := A[i][i]
  for j := 0 to nbRow(A)
    eigenVector_i[j] := M[i][j]
